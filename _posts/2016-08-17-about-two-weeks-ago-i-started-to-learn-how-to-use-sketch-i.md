About two weeks ago I started to learn how to use Sketch. I had wanted to design for a long time and finally had the opportunity to purchase a license, get some tutorials, and open my first blank template. 

Design is hard! I can't say "I'm constantly reminded" because I haven't been designing for years (again, only two weeks of using Sketch!) but if I guess I am reminded of how much "good design" is a combination of other things: good creativity, efficient workflow, clear vision, strong principles, and great mentors. At least those are a few of the things I've been thinking about when designing.

Ha. Designing. More like stealing----like taking a bite from a really good burger, chewing it, spitting it out, and saying that you made that. No, but really, most of my time has been spent looking at good designs----simple UIs, cartoon-y landscapes, and icons----and copying them. For example, a colleague of mine made this UI for an internal application designed to help CS reps look at their client's account from a back-door (wow, that sounds sketchier than I thought. It's harmless, tho):

I found it on his Dribbble page and was struck by its quirky colour palette, it's simplicity, and the use of shadows (remember, this was my second Sketch project ever). Here's my final result, after about an hour and a half of work:

Not too shabby, eh? Looks better than my first UI:

For now, though, I'm working on these few things as I continue to copy and study good UIs:

* Efficiency: Goodness, this is a hard one. After two weeks I've definitely improved but some of these designs can take me a looong time to make, much longer than it'll take a lead UX/UI designer. This made me realise that a good designer is also an efficient designer. I'm keen to continue to learn new methods to streamline my workflow.
* Colours: Lots of pretty colours can look absolutely terrible next to each other. I had a pretty creative and artistic background but I'm still constantly reminded that I need to continue to practice my colour-blending screens. Choosing the wrong colour can make a good design element die.
* Arrangement: I've heard the lead UI guys at work talk about how they like to leave _n_ pixels of padding next to this or that icon, or above or below headers. There's lots of little talk like that which I'm keen to develop, and understand why.
* UX: Usually you'll see both UI and UX thrown around with only a dash in between, but believe me, even with two weeks of design under my belt I can tell you that the _dash_ is more like a chasm. You can have something that looks pretty but is terrible UX. Something like what my colleague Peter pointed out on this tab I built:
